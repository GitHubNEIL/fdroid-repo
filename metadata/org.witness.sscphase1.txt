Summary:ObscuraCam
Description:
A "Visual Privacy" app developed with WITNESS (http://witness.org).
Ever capture someone in a photo or video, and later realized they may not want to be in it? Not comfortable posting a friend, family member or child's face on the internet? Tired of Facebook, Google and other sites "auto detecting" faces in your photos?
ObscuraCam is a visual privacy app for photo and video, that gives you the power to better protect the identity of those captures in your photos, before you post them online.
